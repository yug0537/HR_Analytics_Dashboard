- Employees with the salary below or equal to 5k,experience around 1 year,having age between 26 to 35 have the maximum attrition.
- Laboratory technician,sales executive and HR department have more attrition.
- Also we got the average salary,and average years spend in a company in each department.
- Males have more attrition count in Research and development,Sales departments.
  
## Final Conclusion
Company must focus on lowest salaried employees and need to increament in their salary also those having experience of one year or so need to find the reasons of their leavings plus the age group between 26 to 35.
